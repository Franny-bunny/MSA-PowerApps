# MSA-PowerApps
The target persona of this app is the first year student in UNSW who are going to do Commerce and major in Accounting.
I realized that UNSW changed the course names and outlines for 2021, and it's really difference than previous. 
So it will be extremely hard for them to ask for advices from previous students, as there are so many changes and even change of course code.
Without the app, students need to search the courses again and again, if they are not familier with UNSW Handbook, it will be difficult and spend lots of time.
I believed that this app could guide the new UNSWers and provide them some guidlines with how to select the courses.
There are complusory courses, accounting major core courses as well as the elective course.
Student can search and plan their course selections using this app.
On the other hand, the Excel file is linked with OneDrive, so that students can update their course selection any where any time; 
and it can be quickly shared to your friends and other students.
